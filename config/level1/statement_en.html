            For this challenge, multiple versions of the same game are available. Once you have proven your skills on this first version, you will access a higher league and extra rules will be unlocked.
                        <br>
          This is my first contribution, and it is still work in progress. As such, I haven't implemented leagues. <br>
          It means that currently, everything is already available. For future leagues, I plan on making bonuses such as TELEPORT and REVERSE available later.
            Also, I might only use simple maps (empty, or no teleport) for the starting leagues. Up for discussion.

          CodeSnake is a multiplayer game based on the classic single player snake game.<br>
		  The objective is to reach a size of 12, or to be the last one alive.<br>

        </h2> 
        <div><div class="statement-rules-content"><p>
		 The game is played on a looping grid (going out of the grid will teleport you on the other side).<br>
            Your snake wants to eat <b>A</b>pples, to increase his size, while the opponent snake wants to eat <b>B</b>lueberries.<br>
            <br>
		 The Grid is represented by :<br>
		 - '.' for empty cells.<br>
		 - '0' for your snake.<br>
		 - '1' for opponent snake.<br>
		 - 'A' for the apple.<br>
		 - 'B' for the blueberry.<br>
		 - 'W' for a wall.<br>
		 - 'T' for the TELEPORT Bonus. // Upper league <br>
		 - 'R' for the REVERSE Bonus. // Upper league <br>
            <br>
		 Each turn, you must output a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN), moving your snake in this direction.<br>
		 If your head touch a wall or a snake (body or head), you are eliminated.<br>
            <br>
            If your head move on an Apple, the following will occur :<br>
            - Your size will increase by 1.<br>
            - A new apple will appear at random (but at least 4 cells of any snake head).<br>
            You can also eat Blueberries, but it will only make them reappear somewhere else (your length doesn't change).<br>
            Note : Everything is reversed for your opponent, so he need to eat Blueberries to increase in size.<br>
            <br>
		 In upper leagues, you can also use bonuses (BOOST, TELEPORT). <br>
            You'll need to add the bonus you want to use after your move. Example : MOVE REVERSE<br>
            REVERSE : Your snake head and tail are swapped ( !! Warning !! Your tail direction is not the same as your head !!)<br>
            TELEPORT : Your snake will teleport 2 cells in chosen direction, skipping the next cell. This can be used to jump over walls.<br>
            <br>
		 The game last for 200 turns, or until one of the following condition is true : <br>
		- 1 player reaches a size of 12<br>
		- Only 1 player remains<br></p></div>
